    <p>Each player has his own cards. Storyteller plays card when it is mentioned as non-insignificant part of story. Storyteller changes by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Passing. Storyteller may discard a card.</li>
      <li>Interruption by exact element. Need not be exact words.</li>
      <li>Interruption by interrupt (red) card of matching group when storyteller plays a card</li>
      <li>5 sec pause</li>
      <li>Not making sense</li>
    </ul>
    <!--In all cases of storyteller changing, storyteller must draw a card.
Interruptions if disputed, are resolved by consensus of players not involved in dispute. If interrupter judged wrong, discard card used for interruption and draw 2 cards.
